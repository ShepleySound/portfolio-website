# Personal Portfolio

My personal portfolio website, built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

I hope to use the site to host a blog once I have content written out. For now, the structure exists to do so using MDX. In the future, I may move that responsibilty to an existing CMS platform such as Sanity.io, or take a shot at building my own!
